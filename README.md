# mobile-flashcards Project

This is my mobile-flashcards final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course. The goal of this app is to implement mobile app with react native, meeting requirements from the review rubric here: [Project Specification](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1021/view)


## TL;DR

To use this mobile-flashcards app right away:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn run ios`

## Important
You will need to install the expo app on your iphone and follow directions to get app running, or you will need an IOS simulator environment.

## Create React Native App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#getting-started).
