# mobile-flashcards Project

This is my mobile-flashcards final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course. The goal of this app is to implement an Apple IOS mobile app with react native, meeting requirements from the review rubric here: [Project Specification](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1021/view)


## TL;DR

To use this mobile-flashcards app right away:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`
* scan the QR code from your phone with the expo app or launch the IOS simulator with `i`

## Important
This App has been tested to work with the IOS simulator and expo app running on iPhone. You will need to install the expo app on your iphone and follow directions to get app running, or you will need an IOS simulator environment.

## Create React Native App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#getting-started).
